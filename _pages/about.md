## Who am I?
======

Hello, and thank you for visiting my profile page!  
I'm a 1st-year Master's student in Computer Science at the Institute of Science Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Institute of Technology), currently conducting research in the Inoue Lab.

My academic interests lie at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, with a strong passion for Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models, and their potential to support language learning.

I’m also a huge fan of the Natural Approach and Comprehensible Input theory, and I believe that the age of AI offers an exciting opportunity to rethink and improve how we teach and learn languages.

## What is my research about?
======

My research focuses on **elaborative text simplification**, a subfield of text simplification that aims to enhance the **comprehensibility** of texts not by removing difficult content, but by **adding helpful explanations** — a powerful approach especially for language learners. I'm particularly interested in how we can implement and scale this idea using latest Large Multimodal Models.

I presented my first research project, *“Elaborative Text Simplification via Target Estimation using Large Language Models”*, at **NLP2025 (言語処理学会第31回年次大会)** in Nagasaki, Japan.
